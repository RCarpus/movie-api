# Movie API

## Description
This API will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.  
At the moment, this project only includes a simple home page index.html and a documentation page.

## How to run
To run locally, download and unzip the files, and run server.js using Node. Navigate to port 8080 in your browser. This will take you to the home page. If you add a file extention that includes the string 'documentation' you will be taken to the documentation page.
