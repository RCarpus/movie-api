    <h2>This page (and the entire contents of this API) are mostly empty. It seems the author of this API has no idea what he is doing at this point in time. But at least he was able to get this page to you!</h2>
    <p>This API will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
